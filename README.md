Slot Machine Game Description

Welcome to the exciting world of the Slot Machine Game! This interactive game combines the thrill of a classic casino slot machine with graphical visualization using the Processing library.

Gameplay Overview:

Objective:
Your goal is to spin the reels and match symbols to win payouts. The game starts with a balance of $10,000, and you can place bets on each spin.

Symbols and Payouts:
The slot machine features six symbols: Cherry, Lemon, Orange, Bell, Star, and Seven. Each symbol has different payout rates:

Matching three symbols yields higher payouts than matching two symbols.
If two symbols match, a reduced payout applies.
Betting:
Before spinning, you can enter your desired bet amount. Ensure your bet is within your current balance to proceed. Invalid bets will prompt you to enter a correct amount.

Game Interface:

The main screen displays the current balance and prompts you to enter a bet amount.
Three reels show images corresponding to the symbols as they spin.
A "Spin" button triggers the reels to spin once you've entered a valid bet amount.
Spin Mechanics:

Each reel stops randomly after a set duration, simulating the spinning process.
After the reels stop, the game calculates the payout based on the matched symbols.
Payouts are displayed along with the result of the spin.
Winning and Losing:

Matching three symbols awards a payout proportional to your bet amount and the symbol's payout ratio.
If no matching symbols appear, your balance decreases by the bet amount.
Game Progress:

The game logs each spin, recording the spin result and payout history.
Your current balance updates after each spin, reflecting wins and losses.

If your balance reaches zero, the game ends, and you're notified that the game is over.
